DESCRIPTION: Seems to test validity of <foreign> element, which is part of base DITA, plus filtering within foreign. 
MAY DUPLICATE: other tests of <foreign>
BUILD TO: preprocess (can stop early, seems to only test validity of original source + filter)
NOTES: 
* Uncertain what bug led to this test case, should remove test case if cannot come up with purpose
* Need to correct paths to use src/
