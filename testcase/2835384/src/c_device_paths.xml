  <conbody> 
	 <p>A “device path” is defined as the communication path from Field
		Communications Server to the physical network to which a field communication
		device is connected. It identifies the hardware that the device(s) are
		connected to, such as the FCS, I/O module, modem, multiplexer etc. Device paths
		need to be defined on a Field Communications Server for it to recognize your
		hardware configurations and be able to communicate with your devices. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>The following figure illustrates an example of three FF-H1 devices
		connected to the Field Communications Server through the I/O modules on two
		separate FCSs. In this example, each of the devices is located on a separate
		device path, as they are connected via different I/O modules and FCSs.
