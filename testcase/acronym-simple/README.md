DESCRIPTION: simple 90% case for acronym resolution. Test resolution of "first instance", which differs when topics are independent (default HTML) or combined (PDF).
MAY DUPLICATE: abbrev-fulltest, other keyref tests of acronym
BUILD TO: XHTML (generic), PDF, potentially other final output types
NOTES: Need to fix build files, originally written to pull from a different test data directory, now pulling from src/
